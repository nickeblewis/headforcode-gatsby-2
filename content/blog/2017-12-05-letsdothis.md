I have been a contract developer for many years and the Javascript movement has taken leaps and bounds in changing the way we write our code. It is exciting (I think it is at least), it is daunting (yes I have had my struggles too) and when it boils down to it we all need to learn it. JS is the language of the browser and right now that and the mobile devices we all own, is the principle mechanism we use for consuming our web data/content/films/music and so much more.

Through HeadForCode I hope to unwravel some of the complexities around Javascript and teach the use of some great tools. We will also cover aspects of other languages, especially the .NET world and learn how to become full-stack developers!

We shall start somewhere, where do we start in this complicated world of coding, especially with so many different options and choices to make. I didn't really know where to begin at one point having come from a .NET world, at times I felt like I took the blue pill by jumping into the Matrixesque world of JS.

So let's start with GatsbyJS and how this uses React.

I am going to launch a paid-for online e-book here alongside this blog which I hope will be a great resource for all budding devs and those experienced folks equally.

Lets do this and jump straight to the next article - [Gatsby Love](/docs/new-gatsby-sites/)
