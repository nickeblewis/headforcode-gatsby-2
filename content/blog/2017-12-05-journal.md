I am embarking on some exciting work currently around various tools. Having begun work on my own business site, in fact this one you are looking at right now using GatsbyJS, I am also building a new client site with it. It is very cool.

I am going to share with you some of my adventures in the form of a journal :-)

So here we go....

## Bootstrapping new sites

I generally start simply by firing off

``` bash
gatsby new whatever-this-site-is-called
```

However I am starting to think that maybe I should create my own starter template, as there are a few of these other people have created. It would be much easier if I did, as each time I am having to run a bunch of ad-hoc ```npm install``` commands to add the dozen or so NPM packages that are required.

My plan from this would be to create a little library of such things, so a new project boilerplate can be created and I can spin up my client's sites much faster, saving time and money in the process.

## GraphCMS

I recently worked out how to get this to work and you can learn more about what [GraphCMS](http://www.graphcms.com) is via their website. I am planning on using this for sites where customers are going to need to update their own content. I host my sites on Netlify which does have it's own CMS but currently I am weighing up the merits of both systems to learn which I think is going to go down well with people whom are not developers.
