A stack would span both server side and more and more in recent years, the client side. It has become prevalent in our industry for apps to become more client-side heavy.</p>\\n<p>In essence the JAMStack enables us to deliver sites that are more performant, far more secure, cost effective to scale upwards and at the same time to improve the developer's working life. We all wish we can work with easier, nicer tools as that benefit can be passed onto the client too. All of which must be a great thing.

of 2016 was accurately tracked. So this year we will be able to refer back to this document and compare the two. It is interesting to see that the Summer months saw the most traffic with interest sloping off just before Christmas which is probably not all that unusual.</p>\\n<p>A similar pattern can be seen in the sessions graph the fact the figure of 9.7k is higher would make sense because this would account for each of the 6k users making return visits to the website. So I would typically expect this figure to be higher rather than the reverse.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/sessions-5b08715c08a9b54062e97209d323732e-4d2ee.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 652px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 76.38036809815951%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAPCAYAAADkmO9VAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAABaUlEQVQ4y61U207DMAzt//8bj6DCwxAb61a6Nr3m3hofQ0epJm2IWYriOicnx47TJMZIxhia7flN0cPjjp42J9ocevI+kNaahmEgYMdxFB97MON7aQkWiqLgjV4C8NM0pTzPZUMIQWJZlpG1VgjwrZSirutomqbfhNoZ2lVHst5JoKoVvexe6VSVQoh4Vuai0jlHExM2+z1pJltmdiZcBwBajrWCa5Zgw70GSpLQne1mhSHE2xReA3kmajpLZa2vEqJTLqaMxW3WUM1Ex6KnqjHiw6wLrHaUA9aGPhWF20ND2npJ6/3YUlFxE3N7KBC1XzeteD4pzeSaPsrhomJJue2dpLTPWwEaG8SHjd9A8ceJ+zCe1XhWiYOLil+R8f9rG5Ahbeej+Kq11A9OGj/BySg8ACH+AGcfA+szCeKRB57g+vKkhlgA8/q1LA3vGeCloV7LS5w5EgBx3Zj/krb8dWwkzXXteYYP9Z8e7Jtd4HZyGgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Sessions\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/sessions-5b08715c08a9b54062e97209d323732e-4d2ee.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/sessions-5b08715c08a9b54062e97209d323732e-fdd72.png 180w,\\n/static/sessions-5b08715c08a9b54062e97209d323732e-857d1.png 360w,\\n/static/sessions-5b08715c08a9b54062e97209d323732e-4d2ee.png 652w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>The drop of 22% on the session duration is a good sign because this probably suggests that our visitors are now finding the information they need faster than they used to.
