A stack would span both server side and more and more in recent years, the client side. It has become prevalent in our industry for apps to become more client-side heavy.</p>\n<p>In essence the JAMStack enables us to deliver sites that are more performant, far more secure, cost effective to scale upwards and at the same time to improve the developer\'s working life. We all wish we can work with easier, nicer tools as that benefit can be passed onto the client too. All of which must be a great thing. Well it is and I aim to share this with you!</p>\n<p>JAM stands for Javascript, APIs and Markup. </p>\n<h2 id="enter-gatsbyjs"><a href="#enter-gatsbyjs" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Enter GatsbyJS</h2>\n<p>So let\'s get our teeth into building a JAMStack project!
